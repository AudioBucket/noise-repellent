# noise-repellent

An lv2 spectral noise reduction plugin.

For Debian based systems you will need this packages to compile: lv2-dev libfftw3-dev

Compiling instructions: make and sudo make install

Warning!!!
This plugin is intended to be used with Ardour. It will introduce latency so it only can be used on tracks in Ardour and not in busses.
It's a work in progress so don't expect it to be like the best comercial options. Moreover I wouldn't rely on it for serious work just yet.
